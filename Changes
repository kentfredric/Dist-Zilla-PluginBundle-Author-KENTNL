        Add hard deps on Net::SSLeay and

          without these, and they work when force-installed on 
          win32.

          of Dist::Zilla.

0.01001714 2010-06-03 10:11:42 Pacific/Auckland

        A little better documentation. Nobody else
        should care, but I'm likely to forget what my own code does.

        More of my fail. Tweaking so I can 
        KENTNL_TWITTER_ONLY=1 dzil release 
        and get a dumb no-git no-cpan twitter release.

        Re-attempted release of 0.01001712
