0.01023311 2011-01-01T19:31:37Z
 [BugFixes]
 - Ini generation previously produced "Prereq" instead of the now-standard
   "Prereqs". This is now fixed.

 [Dependencies]
 - Dropped Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PortabilityTests.
 - Added Class::Load

 [Features]
 - Ships now with minting profile 'Author::KENTNL'. New dists can be minted
   via "dzil new -P Author::KENTNL Some::Dist::Name". This profile is
   shipped in the ShareDir for this module name.
 - Consuming dists can now set 'git_versions = 1' as a flag to this plugin
   to use Git::NextVersion instead of AutoVersion::Relative.
 - Now ship .perltidyrc files with all dists by adding an exclusion to
   PruneCruft/GatherDir. Have to drop portability tests as a result.

 - Internal Loading code replaced with Class::Load.
