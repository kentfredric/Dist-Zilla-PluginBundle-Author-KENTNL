2.002001 2013-11-18T03:36:33Z
 [00 Bugfix]
 - Use Module::Metadata to get Module::Build version ( avoid bugs with
   mantissa shortening in tests )
 - Refactor code to share more logic

2.002000 2013-11-11T11:09:48Z
 [00 Minor]
 - Swap out Test::Compile with Test::Compile::PerFile, which is marginally
   faster.

2.001000 2013-11-05T09:25:27Z
 [00 Minor]
 - Reasonably sizeable tooling changes to propagate more develop deps

2.000000 2013-10-12T05:23:24Z
 [00 Major]
 - Versioning scheme now back to single-decimal.
 - If you are downstream and this breaks things, please learn to normalise
   upstream versions.
 - Default versioning scheme for new dists is now single-decimal.

1.9.0 2013-09-26T12:07:46Z
 [00 Major]
 - Well not hugely major, declared develop depends change starting this
   release.
 - @Author::KENTNL is develop_required ( as you will need that bundle if
   you do any dev work on consuming things without modifiying them )
 - @Author::KENTNL::Lite is now develop_suggests only, to indicate that
   bundle can be somewhat used to work on consuming things, as long as you
   edit the right dist.ini's to make it so.

1.8.4 2013-09-26T11:16:23Z
 [Bugfix / Minor]
 - Update to avoid Win32 Test::Compile issues.

 [Bug Fixes]
 - stop dropping travis.yml files

   modules that reverse-engineer bundles

1.8.0 2013-08-08T00:57:13Z
 [!Major]
 - The way dependencies are declared for this module are aggressively
   overhauled and much more tightly follow upstream versions. This is

   started taking an array instead, by using an array. ( External interface

   to use Git::NextVersion instead of AutoVersion::Relative.

 [Packaging]
