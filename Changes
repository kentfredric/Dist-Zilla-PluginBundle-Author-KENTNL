        Add Test::EOL dependencies.

0.01002321 2010-06-09 17:13:23 Pacific/Auckland

        Add hard deps on Net::SSLeay and
          IO::Socket::SSL. Net::Twitter does not work
          without these, and they work when force-installed on 
          win32.
        This release is also intending to test my patched version
          of Dist::Zilla.

        A little better documentation. Nobody else
        should care, but I'm likely to forget what my own code does.

        More of my fail. Tweaking so I can 
        KENTNL_TWITTER_ONLY=1 dzil release 
        and get a dumb no-git no-cpan twitter release.

        Re-attempted release of 0.01001712 
        except with a (hopefully) working .netrc so 
        the twitter thing Actually Works(TM).

0.01001712 2010-06-03 08:54:05 Pacific/Auckland

        Added Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Twitter to the chain.
