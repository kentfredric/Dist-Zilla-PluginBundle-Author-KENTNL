DESCRIPTION
    This is the plug-in bundle that KENTNL uses. It exists mostly because he
    is very lazy and wants others to be using what he's using if they want
    to be doing work on his modules.

METHODS
  bundle_config
    See the "PluginBundle" role for what this is for, it is a method to
    satisfy that role.

    all of these have to merely exist to constitute a "true" status.
